13. lag & low fps
recommended system requirements
• cpu: p4 or equivalent amd at 2ghz or more, better with hyperthreading technology or dual-core (ror has dualcore support)
• ram:512 mb of ram
• video card: 3d accelerated with 128mb of vram or more
• directx 9c on windows, or glx on linux
• supports force feedback joysticks and wheels (except on linux)
• supports 3d sound effects with multichannel sound cards (enable the hardware sound renderer)

these are the requirements to run
basic vehicles
to run more complex vehicles (gabester's
cars/cranes/etc) it's suggested to have a
faster pc.
ror is a cpu intensive simulator, so the faster
cpu you have, the better it is.
if you have low fps, the only fix is to upgrade
your pc.
ex. amd phenom 9600 is enough to use gavril zeta
at 30-40fps.

14. interest points
= here you can find the wiki, to know more about
ror and check the changelog.
-you can report any bug by using redmine.
you can find it here. please be sure your bug is not
in the list yet.
-forums are the heart of ror community, you
will find a lot of interesting things there.

15. multiplayer
-you can play multiplayer by opening rorconfig.exe
and going into network tab, choose a server and
click “save & play”.

note = you must have the cars people
use to see them, or they will be
invisible for you

16. conclusion
